These are neat tricks and you can use them in *conventional* ways.

<!--*-->

* Which tag has the most blog posts?
* What topics do I blog about the most?
* Which authors have blogged recently?
* What domains do I link to the most?

<!--*-->

There's *so much* you can find out about your site.

<!--*-->

And there are *so many* problems you can **solve with Jekyll**.

<!--*-->

* Read!
  + [Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
  + [Liquid for Designers, Shopify](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/liquid-for-designers)
  + [Shopify Liquid Basics](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid)
* Experiment!
* Search!

<!--*-->

And once you figure something out or have an *aha!* moment

<!--*-->

*Write about it!*

<!--*-->

Thank you! *<3*
